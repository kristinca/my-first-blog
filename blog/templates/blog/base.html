                <h2><a href="">Monty Python - Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life</a></h2>
                <pre>
                    Some things in life are bad
                    They can really make you mad
                    Other things just make you swear and curse
                    When you're chewing on life's gristle
                    Don't grumble, give a whistle
                    And this'll help things turn out for the best
    
                    And always look on the bright side of life
                    Always look on the light side of life
    
                    If life seems jolly rotten
                    There's something you've forgotten
                    And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
                    When you're feeling in the dumps
                    Don't be silly chumps
                    Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
    
                    And always look on the bright side of life
                    Always look on the light side of life
    
                    For life is quite absurd
                    And death's the final word
                    You must always face the curtain with a bow
                    Forget about your sin
                    Give the audience a grin
                    Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
                    
                    So always look on the bright side of death
                    Just before you draw your terminal breath
                    
                    Life's a piece of shit
                    When you look at it
                    Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
                    You'll see it's all a show
                    Keep 'em laughin' as you go
                    Just remember that the last laugh is on you
    
                    And always look on the bright side of life
                    Always look on the right side of life

                <h2><a href="">Monty Python - Galaxy Song</a></h2>
                <pre>
                    Whenever life gets you down, Mrs.Brown
                    And things seem hard or tough
                    And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft
                    And you feel that you've had quite enough
    
                    Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
                    And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour
                    That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned
                    A sun that is the source of all our power
    
                    The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
                    Are moving at a million miles a day
                    In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour
                    Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way
    
                    Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars
                    It's a hundred thousand light years side to side
                    It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick
                    But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide
    
                    We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
                    We go 'round every two hundred million years
                    And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
                    In this amazing and expanding universe
    
                    The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
                    In all of the directions it can whizz
                    As fast as it can go, the speed of light, you know
                    Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is
    
                    So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure
                    How amazingly unlikely is your birth
                    And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
                    Cause it's bugger all down here on Earth
