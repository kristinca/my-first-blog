            <h2><a href="">Monty Python - Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life</a></h2>
            <pre>
                Some things in life are bad
                They can really make you mad
                Other things just make you swear and curse
                When you're chewing on life's gristle
                Don't grumble, give a whistle
                And this'll help things turn out for the best

                And always look on the bright side of life
                Always look on the light side of life

                If life seems jolly rotten
                There's something you've forgotten
                And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
                When you're feeling in the dumps
                Don't be silly chumps
                Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

                And always look on the bright side of life
                Always look on the light side of life

                For life is quite absurd
                And death's the final word
                You must always face the curtain with a bow
                Forget about your sin
                Give the audience a grin
                Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
                
                So always look on the bright side of death
                Just before you draw your terminal breath
                
                Life's a piece of shit
                When you look at it
                Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
                You'll see it's all a show
                Keep 'em laughin' as you go
                Just remember that the last laugh is on you

                And always look on the bright side of life
                Always look on the right side of life

            <h2><a href="">Monty Python - Galaxy Song</a></h2>
            <pre>
                Whenever life gets you down, Mrs.Brown
                And things seem hard or tough
                And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft
                And you feel that you've had quite enough

                Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
                And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour
                That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned
                A sun that is the source of all our power

                The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
                Are moving at a million miles a day
                In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour
                Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way

                Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars
                It's a hundred thousand light years side to side
                It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick
                But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide

                We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
                We go 'round every two hundred million years
                And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
                In this amazing and expanding universe

                The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
                In all of the directions it can whizz
                As fast as it can go, the speed of light, you know
                Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is

                So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure
                How amazingly unlikely is your birth
                And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
                Cause it's bugger all down here on Earth
